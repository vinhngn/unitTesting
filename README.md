# Unit Testing

### Project Task:
This repository contains the functions that calculate:
- The total number of characters (excluding spaces).
- The total number of vowels.
- The total number of digits.
- Unit testing to check the correctness of the program.

### What My Unit Testing Includes:
- Checking string with normal input strings.
- Checking string with special characters.
- Checking string with empty strings.
- Checking string with numbers.
- Checking string with a combination of characters and numbers.
- Checking string with null input.

### Instructions:
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Netbeans.
3. Navigate to `CalcTest.java` in the Test Packages to see the tests I have written.
4. Click on the **Run** tab and choose “Test project” to run my unit tests.
5. You can also navigate to `Calc.java` in the Source Packages to see the source code of my functions.

### Requirements:
- Java JDK 8 or higher.
- JUnit 5.

### Note:
- I haven't created a main method, so if users attempt to "Run project" instead of running "Test project", it will cause an error.

### Further Support:
- Since this program runs on Netbeans, implementing it in a different IDE might require additional setup.
- Please reach out to this email if you need further support: tun36777@temple.edu.
